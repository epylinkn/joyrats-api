JOYRATS API
===========


A placeholder API for JOYRATS projects.

GET /fake-abraham
-----------------

An API endpoint that simulates Abraham's eventual API, which will respond with a 64x64 pixel JPG texture that we can import into Unity.

For now, we'll return just a random image.

```
curl -XGET api.joyrats.com/fake-abraham?x=1

# RETURNS a link to a 64x64 texture image generated by Abraham
> www.joyrats.com/texture00X.jpg

```
